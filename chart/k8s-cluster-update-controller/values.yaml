# The label to look for the nodes to be updated.
# For example in the case of AWS AMI updates, nodes on the cluster should be labeled with what image they're using. Ex: "image!=base-lin-blessed-k8s-1.15-debian-ami-20200130120615" << Nodes NOT desired image.
# Ignore masters. "kubernetes.io/role!=master" << Nodes NOT master.
# Multiple labels are comma separated.
